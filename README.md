# Random Number Generator Using Time

## 📌 Description
This C++ program generates a pseudo-random number using the current system time. It extracts values from hours, minutes, and seconds to compute a number between 0 and 99.

## 🚀 Features
- Generates a number based on the current time.
- Simple and lightweight, without external dependencies.
- Provides a unique output every second.

## 🖥️ Using Any IDE
You can also use any C++-supported IDE such as:

Visual Studio Code
Code::Blocks
Dev-C++
CLion
Eclipse
Xcode (for macOS users)
💡 Steps for IDE Users:
Open the IDE and create a new C++ project.
Copy and paste the code into the main .cpp file.
Configure the compiler settings (if required).
Click Build & Run 
🔹 Note: Ensure that the IDE uses a C++11 or later compiler for compatibility.

## 🛠️ Compilation and Execution
📌 Notes:
Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (G++ for Linux/macOS or MinGW for Windows).
If using Windows, you may need to run random_number.exe instead of ./random_number.

To compile the program using **G++ (GNU Compiler)**, run:
```sh
g++ random_time.cpp -o random_number
./random_number
